# Instances
Data for problem instances generated in various research papers

The following problems are currently available,
1. The Pooling Problem : a well-known NP-hard nonconvex problem having bilinear constraints
2. Biobjective MILP : mixed-integer linear problems with a bounded feasible region and two objective functions

More problem types will be added in due course.

There is one directory for each of the above problems. Each directory contains a readme file that gives some explanation of the data format and usage and
also includes the citation to use for the corresponding data.
